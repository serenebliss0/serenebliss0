# 🌸 hiii, i'm Semire Ajayi aka. Serenity

🎓 A 1st Year, Computer Science student @ **Pan-Atlantic University**  
💻 currently exploring the art (and madness) of **C#**, **Rust**, and **C**  
☕ powered by curiosity, caffeine, and a little bit of chaos  

---

### ✨ about me
i like solving problems, building things that (eventually) work, and learning literally everything.  
when i'm not coding, i’m reading, writing, learning Illustrator, After Effects, 3D Modeling in blender, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, or just vibing with music.  

---

### 🧠 currently
- learning more about `Object Oriented Features`, `Arduinos` and `Rust`
- experimenting with creative coding projects  
- trying not to break my code (again 😅)  

---

### 🛠️ tools i use
`C#` • `Rust` • `PostgreSQL` • `Python` • `Git` • `VS Code` • and the `Arduino IDE`
